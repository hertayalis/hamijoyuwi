Why couldn’t we get her back as Quinn on B&B???
General Hospital’s Rena Sofer Returning as Lois
Rena posted online shortly after she left that she would not ever return to B&B. Probably some behind the scenes stuff.

We know who he favours and I don’t want to see RS wasted on this crap show anyway she is too talented for that.

Take Jack Wagner as Nick, Sean Kanan as Deacon, Ashleigh Brewer as Ivy (they completely ruined her), and Krista Allen (Taylor) and they had Lesley Ann-Down for goodness sakes! And I’m really scared for Tanner Novlan because they are going to let Sheila ruin him.</p><p><span class=post-likes>3 Likes</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmpp2jqK6osYybppqqlKh8tXvRnqWaZaKawba%2BzaKloGdoZoJ5gJY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./martin-sensmeier-bio-is-he-married-who-is-the-wife-what-is-his-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Martin Sensmeier Bio, is he married, who is the wife, what is his net worth?</span></a>
