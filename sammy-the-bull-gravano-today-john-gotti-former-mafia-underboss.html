The Former Underboss Has A Podcast</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Netflix’s true-crime docuseries <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Get Gotti</a> charts the “meteoric rise and crashing fall” of John Gotti, who once led America’s most powerful mafia family. Underboss <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Salvatore “Sammy” Gravano</a>, better known as “Sammy The Bull,” aided the infamous “Teflon Don,” as he was called, in his ascent to power.</p><p>But he also sealed his downfall by cooperating with the government in a trial that sent Gotti to prison for life.</p><p>In addition to their status as two of the most powerful men in New York, Gotti and Gravano were among the most surveilled, the Netflix doc contends. The <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>FBI planted bugs</a> inside buildings where they frequently met, and those recordings eventually broke Gravano’s loyalty to Gotti, according to ABC News.</p><p>Gravano thought Gotti was setting him up to take a fall, and decided to strike a deal with the FBI in November 1991.</p><p>After 23 years in the mob, Gravano testified against Gotti, leading to guilty verdicts for five murders, including the assassination of previous Gambino “boss of bosses,” Paul Castellano.</p><p>After receiving a life sentence, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Gotti died of cancer</a> in a Missouri prison hospital in June 2002.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Yvonne Hemsey/Hulton Archive/Getty Images</p></figure><h2>Sammy The Bull Speaks</h2><p>As part of his FBI deal, Gravano — who admitted to carrying out his first mob hit in 1970 (for the Colombo family) — confessed to <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>involvement in 19 murders</a>, including the killings of his best friend, Louis Milito, and his brother-in-law, Nicholas Scibetta.</p><p>In exchange for his testimony against Gotti, he only served five years in prison. Following his 1995 release, Gravano entered into the <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>federal witness protection program</a>.</p><p>Living in Arizona and working in construction under a new identity, Gravano didn’t stay out of the spotlight for long, though. He <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>collaborated with author Peter Maas</a> to share his story of “life in the mafia,” in the 1997 New York Times bestseller, Underboss. The same year, Gravano appeared in a nationally televised ABC News <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>interview with Diane Sawyer</a>.</p><p>When Sawyer brought up the Milito hit, Gravano admitted feeling guilty about participating in his friend’s killing. “Oh, I absolutely felt something, tore me up. I knew the wife. I knew the children. It killed me inside,” he said.</p><h2>Back To Prison</h2><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Donaldson Collection/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images</p></figure><p>After leaving witness protection, Gravano relocated to Tempe, Arizona, and began installing swimming pools under the name Jimmy Moran, per The New York Times. Prosecutors alleged that he soon returned to crime, forming a <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>multimillion-dollar Ecstasy gang</a> whose nearly 40 members included his wife, Debra, his son, Gerard, and his daughter, Karen, who later starred on VH1’s Mob Wives.</p><p>He was arrested in February 2000 in Arizona, but charged in Brooklyn because he allegedly bought pills from a New York drug gang.</p><p>Gravano pleaded guilty to drug trafficking charges in Arizona and New York in May 2001, and a judge sentenced him to 20 years in federal prison (to run concurrently with a 19-year Arizona state sentence). After serving the bulk of his time, Gravano was <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>released from a Colorado prison</a> early in September 2017, but will be on federal parole for the rest of his life.</p><h2>A New Chapter</h2><p>Speaking to ABC News again in 2021, Gravano said he <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>still has regrets</a> about his crimes, particularly how his “being a gangster” hurt his family.</p><p>“It was so ugly,” he admitted during the Truth and Lies: The Last Gangster special. “Would you change it? Yes, the way I feel now. But even looking now, I couldn't.”</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"><p>ABC</p></figure><p>Gravano, who turned 78 in March, now lives in Phoenix and <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>hosts a podcast</a> called Our Thing with Sammy The Bull. Already in its fifth season, the program features him “speaking freely” about his former mafia life.</p><p>Gravano, the self-described “Don of Social Media,” also has a <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>YouTube channel</a> (and recently shared an <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>interview with Alec Baldwin</a>) and is <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>active on Instagram</a>, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>X (formerly Twitter)</a>, and <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>TikTok</a>. He <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>sells merch</a>, too, including autographed mug shots.</p><p>However, Gravano will always be best known as the turncoat mafioso who took down Gotti.</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZqyZnaLGbsDHnmSbrZyheqi%2BwK%2BYp6ddqbylrdhmoaignmK0sMDTomSfp6KisrN5zJqdopldqrulsdGbpqyr</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lois-griffin-death.html><span>←</span><span>The Alleged Death of Lois Griffin From 'Family Guy' Is Trending on Social Media</span></a>
