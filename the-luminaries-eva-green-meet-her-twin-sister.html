She explained: "I used to go on my own, my sister wasn’t interested."&nbsp;</p><p id=eDgLMwV8qYfJ data-wc=1><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Everything you need to know about BBC's The Luminaries</a></strong></p><p id=emfwUsGMm1X0 data-wc=85>In early photos of the pair, they look very much alike with blonde hair, which Eva nows dyes. She explained: "I spent five hours at the hairdresser. It’s who I am, I feel more 'me.'" Joy is a business school graduate who now lives in Italy with her husband, where they co-run a wine company. Eva told W magazine: "She's not at all in the business, she lives in Italy, she's married to an Italian count, she's blonde. She's the other me, the happy me!"&nbsp;</p><p id=eJnnk9guJ1LH data-wc=1><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>The Luminaries: the TV show's astrology explained</a></strong></p><p id=eLnK22SPceoa data-wc=35>Eva recently opened up about her character on Luminaries, telling Deadline: "I needed to get into the world and take an American accent, which is not natural to me.

I don’t get much pleasure out of playing the girlfriend all the time. You want to do what the guys do. Especially on this show, it was physically very demanding and very exciting."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5rZ2toYGx%2Bc4WSa25pZ6Sdsm641Kagp5minrK0ecSvmGafopqyr3nMnpytZZiav27A1qKlZquZqMGmvo4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sandi-patty-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Sandi Patty Net Worth</span></a>
