Their daughter, Victoria Heuermann, 26, is an architect at her father's company, RH Consultants and Associates. According to her&nbsp;<a href=#>LinkedIn</a>, she graduated from the New York Institute of Technology in 2019 with a BFA in fine arts. Locals said she's "shy" and a "very nice girl." As for Rex's son? "[He's] a nice kid, a special needs kid," a neighbor informed&nbsp;<a href=#>CBS News</a>.</p><p>An expert told Nicki Swift exclusively that a recently&nbsp;<a href=#>resurfaced clip of the Gilgo Beach suspect showed his thirst for dominance.</a>&nbsp;Mark Bowden, co-founder of&nbsp;<a href=#>TRUTHPLANE</a>&nbsp;and a member of&nbsp;<a href=#>The Behavior Panel</a>, noted that Rex's possible feelings of lacking control could have led to his need to assert power over others. However, his neighbors saw no signs of any unusual behavior. They're astonished at reports that Rex is believed to be a mass murderer. "It's a shocker. I mean, it's a real eye-opener," one told CBS.</p><p>Even&nbsp;<a href=#>Billy Baldwin weighed in on Rex being the alleged Gilgo Beach serial killer.</a>&nbsp;Baldwin shared on&nbsp;<a href=#>Instagram</a>&nbsp;that the two attended the same school and was aghast at the news. "Married, two kids, architect. 'Average guy... quiet, family man.' Mind-boggling... Massapequa is in shock. 23andMe strikes again???" he wrote. Actually, no, Billy. Suffolk County DA Raymond A. Tierney&nbsp;<a href=#>revealed</a>&nbsp;that authorities obtained an "abandonment sample of [Rex's] DNA" during their investigation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtkZn95fI6fmKahnK56qLXLoKZmmpWWsKl50p6popmcYriquMueqWaqla16qbHUnqmmmZ6jfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-you-dont-know-about-niecy-nash.html><span>←</span><span>What You Don't Know About Niecy Nash</span></a>
