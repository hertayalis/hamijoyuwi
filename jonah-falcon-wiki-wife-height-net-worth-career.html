<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Jonah Falcon- Wiki, Wife, Height, Net Worth, Career</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>American television host, actor, writer, and internet gamer Jonah Adam Falcon is from Brooklyn, New York. He attracted notice for claiming to have the largest penis in the world, which can measure up to 13.5 inches (34 cm) when erect.</strong></p><p>Jonah is also a television personality, presenting a call-in program called “Talkin’ Yankees” on Time Warner Cable in Manhattan. He gained notoriety after starring in the 1999 HBO documentary “Private Dicks: Men Exposed.”</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_Worth_of_Jonah_Falcon_Salary_Earnings>What is the Net Worth of Jonah Falcon? Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>When it comes to wealth, Jonah Falcon is not afraid to demonstrate how much he is worth. In essence, he supports himself by working as an actor and media personality. Along with being a witter and playing online games, these are his main means of income.</p><p>His net wealth is increased by each of these endeavors. Falcon’s monthly income is unknown, but as of March 2023, his estimated net wealth was $8 million.</p><p>Jonah has refused to work in the porn business and said that he wants more respectable acting roles despite his claim that he has a large penis. He got into trouble because of his penis because he had to undergo extra screening at San Francisco International Airport because of the noticeable bulge in his pants.</p><p>This shows that he has heard both positive and unfavorable comments about his genitalia. The public’s fascination with his assertion that he has the largest penis can be blamed for the majority of his renown.</p><h2><span id=Where_was_Jonah_Falcon_born_Ethnicity_Nationality_Family_Education>Where was Jonah Falcon born? Ethnicity, Nationality, Family, Education</span></h2><p>Jonah Adam Falcon was born on <strong>July 29, 1970,</strong> at Greenpoint Hospital in Brooklyn, New York, in the United States. His parents are Cecilia Cardelli, a bookkeeper, and Joe Falcon, a seaman.</p><p>Jonah alleged that porn star John Holmes was his biological father and that his father had died when he was just two years old. Despite having a family history, the assertion has not been firmly established. He was the sole kid of his parents.</p><p>Falcon stated that while he was in school, students were constantly mesmerized by the size of his penis. He enrolled in East Harlem School when he was 12 years old and earned his science diploma from Bronx High School of Science in 1988.</p><h2><span id=Is_Jonah_Falcon_Single_Relationship>Is Jonah Falcon Single? Relationship</span></h2><p>For his assertion, Falcon has received a lot of criticism. He claimed that the longest relationship he has ever been in spanned a year in a 2003 interview. We do know that he met over 3000 women in his 20s, but they were all unimportant because he didn’t make a commitment to any of them. The most significant woman in the universe and his mother reside in New York City, where he spends the majority of his time.</p><h2><span id=How_tall_is_Jonah_Falcon_Weight_Hair_Color>How tall is Jonah Falcon?

By the time he was two years old, he had gone on over 3000 dates.</p><p>He regularly visits Los Angeles and Europe, where he has a large following and friends. At the age of 27, Jonah decided to pursue his performing goals once more and started going to acting classes and casting calls.</p><p>Jonah is a well-known television host who can be seen in Manhattan on Time Warner Cable presenting a call-in program called “Talkin’ Yankees.” The song “It’s Too Big,” which Jonah and his buddy Adam Barta released and live-performed on June 19, 2013, was a single.</p><p>He made an appearance in the TCL documentary series “Sex” in April 2011 and in the 2013 film “Unhung Hero” as Falcon.
