Scarborough is one of the few people responsible for the creation of The Fiend’s mask. The Firefly Fun House always portrayed different sides of Bray Wyatt’s character.</p><p>It included puppets such as Mercy the Buzzard, Huskus the Pig Boy, Abby the Witch, and Ramblin’ Rabbit, among others. It seems Bray Wyatt had huge plans for the puppets.</p><p>Scarborough took to Twitter and revealed that Bray Wyatt wanted to play the live action roles of the aforementioned puppets. However, the plans were ultimately nixed.</p><p>Fun Fact: the WWE wanted to bring the #FireflyFunHouse alive, but @Windham6 would only do it if he played the characters himself. Only one was mocked up, and this would’ve been the concept for FFH Huskus. It was hinted, but ultimately shelved. #TheFiend #BrayWyatt</p><p>Bray Wyatt’s creative genius was ultimately squandered in WWE according to many fans. Bray Wyatt also recently stated that fans will be seeing him very soon. We will have to wait and see if Wyatt truly will make his way to AEW or not in the future as fans would love to see him there.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p><strong>What’s your take on this story?
