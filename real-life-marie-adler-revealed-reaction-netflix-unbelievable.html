He wrote: "Two weeks ago I got a call, from Marie. She told me she had just watched the series. Watching it was hard, she said. 'I did cry quite a bit,' she said. But she had decided she wanted to and was glad that she did. She called the show 'excellent.'"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f24348c15757-unbelievable-5-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eInchm9zmOav data-wc=4><strong>Marie praised the show</strong></p><p id=evsbLYQ7xe0K data-wc=74>He added: "I asked Marie if I could share her thoughts on Twitter. She said that would be fine. She brought up one scene in particular—in the first episode, in which she’s confronted by police and recants. Marie has told me before that it can be a struggle for her to put her feelings and thoughts into words. In that scene, she said, Kaitlyn Dever captured her struggle. 'It was, like, perfect,' she said."&</p><p id=eUpRLOpfg2n9 data-wc=1><strong>READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>12 best new shows on Netflix to watch this week</a></strong></p><p id=ez_zkI8AXzHg data-wc=124>According to Ken, Marie also confirmed that she had forgiven both of her foster mothers, who also doubted her story, and has encouraged them to watch it. Ken wrote: "The series shows how two of Marie’s former foster moms doubted her account. Both later apologised to her. Marie forgave both. She kept ties with both. After finishing the series, Marie called both, to reassure them: The show doesn’t demonise you. She encouraged both to watch." Marie added to Ken that she saw the two detectives who tracked down her attackers as "my guardian angels", and Ken concluded: "Watching the re-creation of the Colorado detectives closing in, provided Marie something she didn’t expect. 'Seeing him get put away, that was closure for me,' she said."</p><p id=esHIhb7h_z9U data-wc=1><strong>READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>The Crown season three's first trailer is here – and teases BIG changes at Buckingham Palace</a></strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
