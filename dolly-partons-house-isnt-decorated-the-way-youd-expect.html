According to&nbsp;<a href=#>Amo Mama</a>, "Even though Dolly Parton and her husband, Carl Dean, have been living in a 3,324 square feet mansion since the late '90s, the singer-songwriter doesn't show it off a lot." The only known information about the mansion has been based off of aerial footage.&nbsp;<a href=#>The List</a> reported that&nbsp;"the property has over 10 structures, gazebos, a swimming pool, tennis court, [and] a chapel."</p><p>However, thanks to Instagram, Parton revealed a glimpse inside of her ultra-private estate in March of 2020. Following Kenny Rogers' death, Parton shared <a href=#>a few touching videos</a> in honor of her "Islands in the Stream" partner. While the videos not only&nbsp;paid tribute to Rogers and uplifted fans during the COVID-19 pandemic,&nbsp;Amo Mama&nbsp;stated the videos also showcased the interior design of Parton's home.</p><p>In the videos, fans can see classic yellow-painted walls, hardwood flooring, floral curtains, white window treatments, and Parton's wooden piano. These decor choices are a stark contrast from&nbsp;what Parton typically flaunts in her outerwear. The only accent piece that was reminiscent of <a href=#>Parton's unique fashion style</a> was a colorful bedazzled cross that sat on top of her piano, as screenshotted above.</p><p>While these videos are only a sneak peek of what Parton's home looks like inside, it appears that maybe her taste in furniture is a bit more refined than her taste in fashion.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma3BmZ4Z6e8Ooo6WxXaWus8DOp6pmoJ%2BqwKZ5yKylrWWUmrCwvsCtnJ1lpJ2ybsPAsmSyp6WZeqbEz56arWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chita-rivera-net-worth-134792.html><span>←</span><span>Chita Rivera Net Worth</span></a>
