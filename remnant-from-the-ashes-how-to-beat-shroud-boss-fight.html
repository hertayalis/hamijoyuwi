He can be just a little tricky due to his ability to teleport around the area. Every time you damage him, he zips off to a new location. The trick to this fight is to watch your stamina.</p><h2>Remnant: From the Ashes – How to Beat Shroud</h2><p data-injection=true>It is a good idea to make sure you have some bandages for this fight, as Shroud inflicts bleeding damage when he hits you. He can hit you while teleporting and cause a rain of arrows to fall on you, making him a little frustrating at times. The trick is to keep moving. If you haven’t bumped up your stamina, now’s a good time.</p><p>Like most of the bosses in the game, Shroud summons in minions to help him out. Focus on these ads when they arrive, and continue moving, because you do not want to get cornered and take a load of chip damage. They can swarm you, and then have Shroud attack you from above. <span data-old-style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: 0px;">Weapons that do substantial damage over distance are a good idea here. Close-range weapons are effective up, but when Shroud teleports to an awkward spot with limited angles of entry and exit, you don’t want to prevent yourself from damaging him.</span></p><p>Once you focus on regulating your stamina, clearing your routes of minions and damaging Shroud when you can, this fight should prove to be reasonably straightforward. Make sure you don’t get locked in by minions, and you will do fine.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4d686f5b0a45b38d7d7ce44dbe2ea347?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Aidan O'Brien</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>Aidan O'Brien has been playing games for over three decades and has been writing about them for five years.
