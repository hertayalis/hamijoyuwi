"Luckily for me, it was important that I wasn't that good at French, because of who he was," noted Clive, referring to Sam Spade, the protagonist in Dashiell Hammett's classic 1930 novel .&nbsp;</p><p id=eScmou0srue data-wc=57>"I didn't do very well at French at school," recalled Clive, who left his comprehensive in Coventry after passing just one of his nine O-levels. "So I panicked because I was working with a teacher, learning grammar as if I was having to pass an exam when all I really needed was to speak and sound okay.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Meet True Detective star Kali Reis's famous husband" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/305b37d9e9bf-kali-reis-true-detective.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Meet True Detective star Kali Reis's famous husband" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Meet True Detective star Kali Reis's famous husband</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=e2TaZJn55fP data-wc=28>"When I realised I wasn't going to be tested, I switched tack and learnt it phonetically, like learning an accent, and had a French person working with me."&nbsp;</p><p id=esa1EBqZoH data-wc=81>Sam Spade was most famously played by Humphrey Bogart in John Huston's 1941 adaptation of The Maltese Falcon, and there's no greater Bogart fan than Clive. So when he was approached to take Spade on a new adventure, he admitted: "It was a very easy, quick yes." If there are any perks to his job, then the opportunity to live and work in France – filming around the village of Bozouls, two hours north-east of Toulouse – certainly counts among them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/525a0759d6d6-humphrey-bogart-the-maltese-falcon.jpg><p id=eZRIL-1hYKA data-wc=34>"I made sure I put in the work and looked around," he explained. "I figured that if I was going there, I wanted to stay in a great place and live the full experience."</p><p id=eQZv1je8TLK data-wc=78>Although the original Sam Spade was a younger man, Clive's Monsieur Spade is 60, and decides to remain in France in the 1960s after a case takes him there. Facing his mortality, in one scene he puffs on a cigarette as the village doctor examines him and suggests he give up smoking if he doesn't want to die in an oxygen tent. However, Spade slips back into his old ways, smoking, drinking and having relationships with inappropriate women.</p><p id=eiSpfRZdPP data-wc=18><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Masters of the Air star reveals surprising advice from Barry Keoghan on set of Apple TV+ show</a></p><p id=eTG3b2P4-P data-wc=21><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Apple TV+ shows coming back this year: all the details from Bad Sisters season 2 to Slow Horses season 4</a></p><p id=eWcbWKJTI4D data-wc=28>"I think it was a very clever move of Scott to locate him 20 years later in a different environment, like a fish out of water," Clive reflected.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a59e2d952a82-clive-owen-smart-suit.jpg><p id=ehhnsIcbuaX data-wc=63>Nobody could accuse the actor, who shot to fame as a charismatic conman in 1990 ITV series , of being typecast. Flipping between TV, film and stage roles, Clive has played characters including Ernest Hemingway, former US President Bill Clinton, King Arthur and Sir Walter Raleigh, as well as guesting on Ricky Gervais's show But Spade stands out among his favourite roles.&nbsp;</p><p id=et5zqNaWyMm data-wc=65>"It was a lovely job," he said. "With every job, my first reaction is: 'Why have they come to me? I don't see it.' And then you start to dive into it and something inside me goes: 'Be brave.' I understand that the opportunity is there to mess it up, but then something ignites within me that wants to take it on.
