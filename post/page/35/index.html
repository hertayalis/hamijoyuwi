Closing Thoughts: Three Useful Devices, Depending on Your Needs
I had originally hoped to do a shorter write up on these Amped Wireless devices, as going into the review I knew I didn‚Äôt have all the testing equipment I would like. Ideally, at the very least I‚Äôd want to add at least one 3x3:3 dual-band router and adapter to the charts. 9000+ words later, I‚Äôm still typing. Whew! In retrospect, I probably should have just skipped doing the three routers/three adapters approach, plus the repeater, and made three separate reviews, as then I could have more easily scaled the number of routers (all tested with one adapter) and adapters (all tested with one router).</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Doll Squad and Batman Actress Francine York Dies at 80</h2><time>Jul 25, 2024</time>
