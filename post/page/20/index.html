This post is in partnership with&nbsp;Lundberg Family Farms. Here’s how I make dinner in the summer: First, I open the fridge to see what produce I have.

Often, there are legumes like chickpeas or lentils, and always, there are grains like Lundberg Family Farms rice and quinoa.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../post/page/19/>← Prev Page</a>
