<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Who Are Meghan Markle's Parents?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Have you ever wondered about <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a>? Since the <a href=# title=_self>Suits</a> star began dating <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> back in summer 2016, the world has been obsessed with all-things Meghan. While we know a lot about her career, her background, and her love for Harry, many people still don’t know too much about Meg’s parents, Doria Radlan and Tom Markle. Lucky for you, we’re breaking down everything you need to know about Mr. and Mrs. Markle!</p><p>Meghan was <a href=#>born Rachel Meghan Markle</a> in LA on Aug. 4, 1981, to parents Doria and Tom. The actress’ mother has a master’s degree in social work and works as a therapist and yoga instructor — so impressive! Her father is an Emmy-winning television lighting director. Because of Tom’s job, Meghan spent some of her childhood visiting the set of <a href=# title=_self>Married… With Children</a>, which sparked her future interest in acting. <strong>Watch the video below for more info on Meghan’s parents!</strong></p><p>In the past, Meghan has <a href=#>spoken freely about being biracial</a> and is very proud of her parents’ backgrounds. “‘What are you?’ A question I get asked every week of my life, often every day. ‘Well,’ I say, as I begin the verbal dance I know all too well. ‘I’m an actress, a writer, the Editor-in-Chief of my lifestyle brand The Tig, a pretty good cook, and a firm believer in handwritten notes.’ A mouthful, yes, but one that I feel paints a pretty solid picture of who I am,” she once said.</p><p>“But here’s what happens: they smile and nod politely, maybe even chuckle, before getting to their point, ‘Right, but what are you? Where are your parents from?’ I knew it was coming, I always do,” Meghan continued. “While I could say Pennsylvania and Ohio, and continue this proverbial two-step, I instead give them what they’re after: ‘My dad is Caucasian and my mom is African American. I’m half black and half white.’ I have come to embrace that. To say who I am, to share where I’m from, to voice my pride in being a strong, confident mixed-race woman.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/prince-harry-meghan-markle-royal-titles.jpg><p>Join our <a href=#>Facebook group</a> for the latest updates on Kate Middleton, Prince William, and all things royal!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46mnKCgkaN6rq3RpKOeZaCWv6a606xkamxhbYR1ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lourdes-leon.html><span>←</span><span>Lourdes Leon: Latest News, Pictures &amp;amp; Videos</span></a>
