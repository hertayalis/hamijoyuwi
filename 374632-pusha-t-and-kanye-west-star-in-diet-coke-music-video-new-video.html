Produced by Kanye and 88-Keys, the anticipation has been high ever since Ye and Push were spotted together on the set of the video shoot. The music video for the song arrived earlier today which co-stars Ye.&nbsp;Omar Jones serves as the director for the video which brings a simple yet effective black-and-white aesthetic to the record.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Push's manager Steven Victor recently told Complex that Push's album "is coming sooner than you think," adding that they were coming "back-to-back."
