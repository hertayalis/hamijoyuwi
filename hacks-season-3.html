With its genius blend of funny and poignant, Hacks has garnered many loyal viewers.</p><p>In Season 2 of Hacks, Deborah and her protégé, Ava (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hannah Einbinder</a>), set out on a journey across the U.S. to promote Deborah's brand new material. Laurie Metcalf (of <a href=#>The Conners</a> and <a href=#>The Dropout</a> fame) joins the cast as Deborah's deadpan tour manager, while Devon Sawa appears as Jason, a man with a rugged charm and plenty of ambition to sweep the seasoned comedienne off her feet.</p><p>Season 2 kicks off with a colorful exploration of Deborah's and Ava's adventures on the road. Season 2 ends with the girls taking over Las Vegas, where Deborah has some business meetings to attend. An opportunity knocks on Ava's door, too. But will <a href=#>HBO Max</a> renew the critically acclaimed series for a Season 3?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: HBO Max</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The Season 2 finale of 'Hacks' ends without a cliffhanger.</h2><p>Season 2 of Hacks ends on a wholesome note — with both heroines achieving exactly what they dreamed of. Deborah's new show, titled My Bad, sells out in a record-short time frame — ushering in a fully-fledged career renaissance. The pilot Ava has worked on gets picked up, which marks her return to a more traditional form of employment. The Season 2 finale contains no cliffhangers, which is hardly the most promising sign for fans.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Hacks (@hacks)</a></p></figure><p>The co-creator of Hacks, Lucia Aniello, offered some clarification about the future of the show in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Decider</a>. She and co-creators Jen Statsky and Paul W. Downs have yet to deliver their preferred ending.</p><p>"We do have an idea of how many seasons, but I don't know if we know for sure. The truth is, and we've said this before and I think we've told you this, we know how we want the story to end," Lucia said. "Exactly how many seasons that is to tell that story, I think we're still a little bit open-ended on, but we do know how we want it to end. So for us, we are just in a chapter of a larger story at this point."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube/HBO Max</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Will there be a Season 3 of 'Hacks'?</h2><p>Fear not, fellow Hacks stans, because it was confirmed on June 16, 2022, that the Emmy-winning series is getting a third installment — despite the Season 2 finale only airing less than a month prior.</p><p>“We congratulate Hacks' extraordinarily gifted executive producers and cast, and our partners at Universal Television,” head of original content at HBO Max Sarah Aubrey said, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>. “We are overjoyed at the audience and press response to the new season, and glad to give viewers more of this gorgeous, hilarious, moving show.”</p><p>The president of Universal Television, Erin Underhill, too, weighed in on the news.</p><p>“The first two seasons of ‘Hacks’ — expertly crafted by Lucia, Paul, and Jen —gave us beloved, complex characters who make us laugh and feel deeply. We’re thrilled that our HBO Max partners have renewed this standout series for a third season, and we can’t wait to see what’s next for Deborah, Ava and the rest of our outstanding ensemble.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>We're climbing a mountain.
