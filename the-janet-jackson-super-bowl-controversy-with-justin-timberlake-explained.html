What followed was a moment that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">is still being talked about to this day,</a> as many wonder whether it was planned, and who really was to blame.</p><h2 id=h-what-happened-between-janet-jackson-and-justin-timberlake-at-the-super-bowl-xxxviii-halftime-show data-injectable=false>What happened between Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake at the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=668 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=409 data-current-count=409 data-injectable=true>When Timberlake was wrapping up his performance of his single “Rock Your Body” and singing the words “Bet I’ll have you naked by the end of this song,” he grabbed Jackson’s rubber costume, pulling on it and ripping it, to reveal, to almost 150 million viewers, the exposed breast of the “Rhythm Nation” singer. Covering her nipple was a silver sunburst shield.</p><p data-characters=499 data-current-count=499 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Federal Communications Commission attempted to fine CBS $550,000</a>, a record amount at the time, for violating their indecency regulations, which was ultimately voided, while the NFL banned halftime show producer MTV from future editions. Jackson was blacklisted for years, while Timberlake only became more popular. The creation of YouTube was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly</a> inspired by people’s search for footage of the incident, which unless they had recorded the Super Bowl, there was no way of accessing.</p><p data-characters=673 data-current-count=673 data-injectable=true>It was eventually revealed that Timberlake’s stunt had been planned, but that the intended result was for only the black rubber fabric to come off, leaving Jackson’s red laced bra intact. The older singer released an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">apology, damage-control video</a> at the request of CBS shortly after, saying that the decision to change the performance to include the bit was made without the knowledge of MTV, CBS, or NFL. Timberlake also stated that the nipple reveal was accidental and apologized if it offended anyone. “I’m frustrated that my character is being questioned,” he said at the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">2004 Grammys</a>, broadcast by CBS, and from which Jackson was banned.</p><p data-characters=244 data-current-count=244 data-injectable=false>The public accused Timberlake of throwing Jackson under the bus and not standing up for her enough in the face of the contrasting reactions. He would later speak on how double standards affected Jackson, in a 2006 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MTV</a> special about his career.</p><p>“I was sort of dumbfounded at how crucified the whole thing was. It’s an understatement to say that it was sort of unfair. If you consider it 50/50, I probably got 10% of the blame and I think that says something about society. I think that America is harsher on women, and I think that America is unfairly harsh on ethnic people. At the time it was happening it was so crazy to me that I didn’t handle it the best way I could have.”</p><p data-characters=539 data-current-count=539 data-injectable=false>According to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">2022 Lifetime docu-series</a> about Janet Jackson, the “Rock Your Body” singer invited her to perform at the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Bowl halftime show he headlined in 2018</a>, but she declined. The whole event was brought back into the limelight following a wave of criticism against Justin Timberlake from Britney Spears supporters in 2021 who claimed both she and Janet Jackson had been victims of his misogyny. He issued a public apology on his Instagram <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">apologizing to both women</a> and to Jackson directly, for the first time ever.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TBqbGMo5innaRit6Kvyqymp2Wjqr2mvoybprCkXZi8r8DRqK2eqqOueri106Fko62jqbavedOipJudoqGurLGMnq%2BppJGeu6awjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./matt-ryan-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Matt Ryan Net Worth: Career &amp;amp; Charity</span></a>
