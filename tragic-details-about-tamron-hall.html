On breaking the glass ceiling at 43 years old, she told <a href=#>Essence</a>, "I'm a part of this for women, for Black women, for all of us." During that time, Hall was very busy. In addition to co-anchoring the 9 a.m. hour of Today, she continued to anchor MSNBC's&nbsp;News Nation, as well as continued to host Deadline: Crime with Tamron Hall on Investigation Discovery. She told Essence&nbsp;that upon inking the Today contract, she channeled her inner Lena Horne, who was one of her biggest inspirations: "I have a jacket and a bracelet that belonged to her and when we finished the deal I put them on and posed in the mirror."</p><p>By January 2017, Hall was a shining star on NBC, co-hosting her hour of the popular morning show alongside&nbsp;Al Roker. The hour, titled, Today's Take was the #1 show in its time slot. Roker posted a <a href=#>tweet</a> in excitement saying, "Congrats to our #TODAYsTake @TODAYshow 9am producers for producing the #1 morning show 7 weeks in a row!! @tamronhall and I are very blessed."</p><p>But despite the show's success, questions started brewing after <a href=#>NBC announced</a> it was bringing on former Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly to host a daytime news show. Soon, Hall's future on&nbsp;Today&nbsp;<a href=#>was clearly, albeit inexplicably, in jeopardy</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma25hZYVye9OrmKChk2KxpsDAoqOsZZGXvLbAjK2Ypqqfo3qprculZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-10-best-marvel-memes-that-are-strangely-relatable.html><span>←</span><span>The 10 best Marvel memes that are strangely relatable</span></a>
