By the age of five, she knew that a life in the limelight was her destiny, telling&nbsp;<a href=#>NPR</a> that she was inspired while watching television with her grandmother. After&nbsp;seeing Lola Falana on screen, she recalled,&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was like, oh, that's what I'm going to do. I'm going to be Black, fabulous, and on TV."</p><p dir=ltr>At 15, Nash witnessed the unthinkable — her mother being shot by an abusive boyfriend with a sawed-off, double-barreled shotgun. "Easter Sunday morning, shot her down like a dog in the street," she recalled at a 2010 fundraiser for victims of domestic violence in Southern California, per <a href=#>WABC-TV</a>. Her mom, Margaret Ensley, survived the incident, but about seven years later, tragedy struck the family a second time.</p><p dir=ltr>Per NPR, <a href=#>Nash's younger brother Michael Ensley</a> was shot and killed on his high school campus, after being caught up in a love triangle. At that point, Margaret went into a bad bout of depression. "My mother said, 'I give up," the actor told <a href=#>People</a> in 2010, but her daughter wasn't about to let that happen. Instead, Nash would sit at her mother's bed every day and crack jokes to lift her spirit. She explained, "That's when I realized comedy was a gift."</p><p dir=ltr>If you or someone you know is dealing with domestic abuse, you can call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1−800−799−7233. You can also find more information, resources, and support at <a href=#>their website</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>If you or someone you know needs help with mental health, please contact the <a href=#>Crisis Text Line</a> by texting HOME to 741741, call the <a href=#>National Alliance on Mental Illness</a> helpline at 1-800-950-NAMI (6264), or visit the <a href=#>National Institute of Mental Health website</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcmpkboJ5e9ahmK1lqaTCbrDOp6tmo56kxG6twaisrWWenrKkxYynmKygXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./liam-pitchford.html><span>←</span><span>Liam Pitchford</span></a>
