What began as a passion project (my little engine that could) evolved into an amazing community of inspiration, support, fun and frivolity. You've made my days brighter and filled this experience with so much joy. Keep finding those Tig moments of discovery, keep laughing and taking risks, and keep being "the change you wish to see in the world."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Above all, don't ever forget your worth - as I've told you time and time again: you, my sweet friend, you are enough.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Thank you for everything.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Xx</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Meghan Markle"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The actress didn't explicitly state why she's closing down The Tig, but a source told People she's giving up the site to focus on her role in Suits and her philanthropic work.
