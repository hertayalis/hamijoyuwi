Carving out an impressive career in the heavyweight division, Browne's prowess in the Octagon has earned him a loyal following among fans of the sport. Jumpstarting&nbsp;his professional career in 2009, Browne signed with the UFC in 2015. Quickly making a name by winning his first consecutive nine bouts,&nbsp;he&nbsp;only lost one of his first 18 professional matches.&nbsp;A serious title contender at one point,&nbsp;Browne was listed at no. 5 in June 2015's official UFC Heavyweight rankings. Upon retiring in 2018,&nbsp;Browne's record stood at 18 wins and 7 losses,&nbsp;with his last win being in January 2016 against Matt Mitrione.</p><p dir=ltr>Just as he is her source of constant support and comfort, Rousey is her husband's biggest fan. "My personal life is better than it's ever been," Browne told Hawaii's <a href=#>Star-Advertiser</a>&nbsp;amid a series of defeats in 2017. "Being with somebody who understands the game, being with somebody who's there to support you as a partner in life instead of being that person who draws that energy out of you ... I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for that," Browne credited Rousey. The power couple also avoided competitiveness in their relationship.&nbsp;"That's one thing we set up early on," Browne said. "She [has] her own work. That's her baby. What I do is my baby."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxhZ4N1f46rpqeckWK%2FsMHSnrBmoKWor6K6w2arq5mmnsBurtGorqedXZ%2B8o3nDqJysZZakv264yK%2Bgp59f</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tommy-g-html.html><span>←</span><span>Tommy G - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
