Luckily, the rest of the "Survivor" competitors are paid some amount, and the longer one lasts, the better the pay. Even the first person eliminated on "Survivor" receives at least $2,500, <a href=#>tweeted</a> former player Jonny Fairplay, and it goes up from there. In addition, each contestant who participates in their season's live reunion show finale receives an additional $10,000.</p><p>"Survivor" contestants reportedly get paid on a sliding scale depending on how long they stay in the game, although specifics seem to stay mostly under wraps. During the first season, third-place contestant Rudy Boesch reportedly received $85,000 and Sue Hawk, who finished fourth, earned $70,000 (per Entertainment Tonight via <a href=#>ABC News</a>). In comparison, Jenna Lewis, who was eliminated mid-season, apparently earned $27,000. EW noted that some All-Star seasons up the ante, with "Survivor: Winners at War" offering a $2 million prize for the winner. Because that season was made up of former "Survivor" winners, every contestant who participated and attended the reunion received at least $35,000.&nbsp;</p><p>So is the money worth the toll the experience takes on a contestant? "Survivor" doesn't struggle to find new contestants, or veterans willing to return, so the compensation and unique experience are seemingly enticing enough to keep people interested in applying for a spot.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbW5ma4Z1e8eormalpZi1brnOp5yyZZSkerTB0a%2Bgr6eiYrCwutOeqq2ZnqnAbrPErWSpmZmZfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./charisma-jamison.html><span>←</span><span>Charisma Jamison</span></a>
