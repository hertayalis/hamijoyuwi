It was a Miracle Drops event put on by Dupart's Kaleidoscope Hair Care line, and the "Sittin' On Top of the World" artist was anything but smooth. "I was real nervous and scared at first. I would hide behind furniture when she would talk to me," she said on a 2021 episode of "Growing Up Hip Hop Atlanta," according to&nbsp;<a href=#>Rickey Smiley Morning Show</a>. Even Dupart admitted that sparks were not exactly flying at first. "[I]t wasn't love at first sight at all." Although the pair did exchange numbers and decided to "link" in the near-future.</p><p dir=ltr>Unfortunately, there was a miscommunication and while Judy believed it was a casual date, Brat believed that Dupart simply wanted to meet about business. The two had an awkward hangout, and the "Give It 2 You" rapper did not reach out to Dupart "for months,"&nbsp;as she recalled on "GUHHA."</p><p dir=ltr>Even once they connected for good, there were other uncomfortable moments. At first, they decided to keep their relationship low-key on several levels. "We were friends for a while, and it kinda happened like that," Dupart told <a href=#>BET</a> in 2021. She also recalled meeting up with Brat at a festival, but since the rapper had not come out to the public, the pair could not hold hands without having their handlers join. Of course, their relationship matured over time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamphZYJxfY6hprBllJZ6o77ArWSmnaRitaa%2BjLCgn51dn7K0v8ScmGacpaWus8CMsJ%2ByZZmperit0qerZqSfq7JurdNmnaKqo6l6tLXGoato</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./joely-richardson-renegade-nell-best-role-yet-exclusive.html><span>←</span><span>Exclusive: Joely Richardson on getting her 'best role' yet as she approaches milestone 60th birthday</span></a>
