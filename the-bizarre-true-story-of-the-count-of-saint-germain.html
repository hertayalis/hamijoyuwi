Yet, that doesn't mean we can be sure that we fully understand him, as the Count seemed committed to muddying the waters of his own life story. It could well be that, given how much he circulated in some very upper-class realms, he was simply hiding humble origins. Or, as more fantastically-minded folks like to claim, he could have been hiding a more mystical secret.</p><p dir=ltr>According to <a href=#>Britannica</a>, various notables of the 18th century confirmed his existence. Writer and politician Horace Walpole wrote that the Count of Saint Germain was in London in 1743, where he was arrested on espionage charges, but then quickly let go. According to "<a href=#>A Dark Muse</a>," this is the first confirmed mention of Saint Germain, who was kicked out of England after his release.</p><p dir=ltr>Years later, he pops up in the court of French king Louis XV but, after a brief bout with serious political influence and infighting, he fled back to England. Seemingly never one to stay in a single place for very long, he then travels in Russia's political circles, then Germany, a few years back in France, and finally Germany for a last time before his death in what many sources say was the year 1784.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCBl21tcm5fqbWmecGisZqqopp6tb7UnmSsrJ%2Bnxm67xWaroZ1dmLy2utNmpp9lo5a2r8CMoJyrpZGeu3A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./terrence-howard-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Terrence Howard Bio (Wiki)</span></a>
