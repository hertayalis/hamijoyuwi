But now that she‚Äôs branched out to do her own spin-off Porsha‚Äôs Family Matters, things have changed.</p><p>That includes her iconic hair look‚Ä¶ While some fans were hoping that a wig was covering up her shorter style, others have lost hope and think that the iconic cut may not be making a return.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2022/01/GettyImages-1356103944-683x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-moment-porsha-revealed-shorter-look>The moment Porsha revealed shorter look</h2><p>Porsha first shocked RHOA fans when she went uber short back in December 2020. While she often goes for a longer hair look, either by wearing her branded wigs or adding in extensions, she often brings the shorter look back.</p><p>For example, in November 2021, the reality TV star donned her pixie cut look again. It appears that this may be her natural look when she isn‚Äôt wearing any other hair accessories or wigs, but this is unconfirmed.</p><p>In December, she shared pictures on Instagram with family, where she wore a cap. These posts showed a glimpse of her much shorter hair, but as her wigs look so natural, it‚Äôs hard to tell whether she really does have longer hair!</p><p>She even werked the pixie cut look back in 2017, before she launched her own wig brand. Lately though, it almost looks like Porsha much prefers having longer locks, leading to worries about whether she has ditched the short hair.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Author üìö (@porsha4real)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-rhoa-star-s-hairstyles-revisited>RHOA star‚Äôs hairstyles revisited</h2><p>We usually see Porsha with long, dark, wavy locks. She may occasionally have her shorter hair on show, but usually she looks incredibly glamorous. Sometimes though, she goes for a straightened hairstyle.</p><p>With caramel and blonde balayage at the bottom of her hair towards the end of the year, it‚Äôs pretty hard to keep up with how often Porsha changes her hair. With her wigs at the grab of a hand, she often switches to all-black hair.</p><p>During her time on RHOA, there was a moment when she had a <a href=# rel=nofollow>straight-cut, sleek bob</a> reaching just below her shoulders. Many wondered if this was a wig when the episodes aired.</p><p>Other times, Porsha has long, curly hair which appears to be windswept and natural. She has had her fair share of hair looks, and as a result, fans are clearly incredibly grateful for her variety of styles.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Author üìö (@porsha4real)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-porsha-is-a-hair-icon-for-many>Porsha is a hair icon for many</h2><p>Porsha is such a hair queen that she has even launched her own brand, <a href=# rel=nofollow>GoNaked Hair</a>. From headband and general wigs, lace and lashes, all of your barnet dreams could be achieved with her help.</p><p>One fan wrote on a November 2021 post, where she sported her shorter bob. They said: ‚ÄúI soooo love your hair like this‚Ä¶ you are beautiful.‚Äù</p><p>Another simply told Porsha: ‚ÄúLove your hair short.‚Äú</p><p>It‚Äôs clear that fans are absolutely loving Porsha‚Äôs shorter hair look, which made its debut on the January 9th episode. So, perhaps she will be showcasing the natural locks a lot more often!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>LOVING this short hair look on Porsha. <a href=#>#RHOA</a> <a href=#>#PorshasFamilyMatters</a></p>‚Äî House of Drooci (@droosion) <a href=#>January 10, 2022</a></figure>View Tweet<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>one thing about Porsha Williams, her hair, clothes and makeup has been on point since she stepped on the RHOA scene. she didn‚Äôt have to go through that glow up stage.</p>‚Äî She Who Shall Not Be Named (@In_A_YamChele) <a href=#>December 28, 2021</a></figure>View Tweet<p class=has-text-align-center>WATCH PORSHA‚ÄôS FAMILY MATTERS ON BRAVO SUNDAYS AT 9 PM ET</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>AND GET FREAKY WITH US ON </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">INSTAGRAM</a> <strong>AND </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FACEBOOK</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfl7%2Biws5om56roJ7BpnnRoaaaZZaWu7R5wKmnq6emlrluvM6rqqGZXaKuunnHmq2eZZSewaS0xJ1koZ2iYraku82immarmKS%2FtXnHmqCr</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./roman-tesh-net-worth-220699.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Roman Tesh Net Worth</span></a>
