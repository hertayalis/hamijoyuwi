In her petition, Audrey stated, "We fully believe that this case has not been taken seriously by local authorities ... it is our firm belief that once you examine the information we have gathered, you will agree that the evidence pointing to Jessica's murder is palpable ... the fact that it has been blatantly ignored by the law is nothing short of derelict to their duties to protect and seek justice for all members of their community."</p><p dir=ltr>In her Change.org petition, Schmidt also claimed her sister was "physically assaulted" by her husband on at least one occasion and "was fearing for her life" in the months and weeks prior to her death. Schmidt also disclosed other evidence that has led her and her family to suspect Justin of involvement in Jessica's death. As of December 2022, the petition has more than 95,000 signatures with a goal of 150,000.</p><p dir=ltr>If you or someone you know is dealing with domestic abuse, you can call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1−800−799−7233.
