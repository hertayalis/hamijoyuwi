Yet, it seems like Pharrell is already working on a new project as he recently <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>reunited</a> with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=5>Justin Timberlake</a> in the studio back in March. Aside from Pharrell's musical projects, he's also siphoning out his creative talents into fashion, as he recently became G-Star's new co-owner.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>PHOTOS: Missy Elliott and Pharrell Williams Reunite at Warner Music Group's Grammys After-Party</a></strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Yet, behind the scenes and big hats, Pharrell is most importantly a doting and stylish husband to wife Helen Lasichanh and a father to their 7-year-old son, Rocket. In honor of the star's birthday, we're taking a lesson in "cool" and looking back at seven snaps of Pharrell and his wife serving up #RelationshipGoals:</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>1. </strong>Nonchalantly posing with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Karl Lagerfeld</a>:</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>2.</strong> Taking on Paris Fashion Week:</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>3. </strong>Heading to the Oscars:</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>4. </strong>Showcasing their photo talents:</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>5. </strong>Proving Valentine's Day is never dull:</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>6.</strong> Making tweed look good:</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>7. </strong>Rocking his and her denim looks:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGegna6zvsSlo2avmaG5qq3MrGSan5Vir6q%2B06GbmrFdrLansYyrnKWZpJ68r7%2FHoqdmn5%2BWubQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tracee-ellis-ross-embellished-mary-jane-flats-7967066.html><span>←</span><span>Tracee Ellis Ross Just Wore the Edgiest Version of 2023's 'It' Shoe</span></a>
