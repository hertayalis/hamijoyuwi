At one point, Offer claims that <a href=#>Olympic</a> divers use ShamWow as a towel. Maybe there's some sad, ShamWow sponsored diver out there who actually does, but it's definitely not the norm. The commercial also claims you can use it as bathmat, which is probably true. You could use an old t-shirt as a bathmat if you wanted to — seriously, no one can stop you — but a bathmat that was meant to be a bathmat is clearly going to be a better bathmat. Don't even get us started on the line "made in <a href=#>Germany</a>. You know the Germans always make good stuff."</p><p>That's not the reason you buy a ShamWow, though. You buy a ShamWow because it "holds 20 times its weight in liquid," as the commercial clearly states. Here's the thing: that's not true.&nbsp;When <a href=#>Consumer Reports</a>&nbsp;tested the claim, they found it only held around 10 times its weight... the same as a sponge. Which, by the way, can also be washed in the washing machine. <a href=#>Popular Mechanics</a>&nbsp;determined the ShamWow doesn't function like the commercials say it's supposed to, pushing around water on certain surfaces, and often needed following up by regular paper towels.&nbsp;</p><p>ShamWow? More like "ShamMediocre."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2BlGlwaWhfqbWmedSnq6iklGLBs8HToWSonl2otaK51qiuaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./selling-the-hamptons-cast.html><span>←</span><span>The High-Powered Cast of 'Selling the Hamptons' Has Cornered the Long Island Real Estate Market</span></a>
