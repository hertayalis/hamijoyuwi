Despite the speculations, Jenny Marrs is not expecting a child in 2022. She and Dave have been happily married for nearly 17 years and already cherish the joy of parenting five children. The couple remains tight-lipped about future additions, but their advocacy for adoption, exemplified by welcoming their eldest daughter Sylvia in 2014, speaks volumes about their commitment to family.</p><h3><strong>Jenny and Dave: A Love Story That Transcends Time</strong></h3><p>Let’s shift gears to matters of the heart. Jenny tied the knot with her husband, Dave Marrs, on April 2, 2005, after meeting in 2002. Despite the challenges of Dave’s job requiring relocation, their bond grew stronger. Dave’s shift to Arkansas in 2004 marked a pivotal moment, and the couple celebrated their 12th wedding anniversary in 2017.

Through a mix of biological and adopted children, the family grew to seven. After initially struggling with infertility, Jenny and Dave embarked on the adoption journey in 2008. A surprise followed: Jenny discovered she was pregnant with twins in 2009. In a heartwarming twist, they adopted their eldest daughter Sylvia in 2013 from the Democratic Republic of Congo. Their family circle expanded further with the arrival of Charlotte, followed by Luke in 2019.</p><h3><strong>Dave and Jenny’s Financial Odyssey: Net Worth and Ventures</strong></h3><p>Now, let’s talk money. The dynamic duo, known for their construction prowess, boasts a net worth between $2 million to $5 million. Their construction company, Marrs Developing, stands as a primary income source, and their appearances on “Fixer to Fabulous” and the spin-off “Fixer to Fabulous: Welcome Inn” add to the coffers.
