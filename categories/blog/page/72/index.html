<a href=../../../../crucial-mx200-250gb-500gb-1tb-ssd-review.html></a>
Last year Micron launched M600 SSD for the OEM market, but unlike in the past there was no simultaneous retail product release. We were told that the M600 firmware features would sooner than later find their way into a Crucial branded product, which finally materialized back at CES when Crucial unveiled the MX200.
The hardware has remained unchanged from the MX100 as the MX200 sports the same Marvell 88SS9189 controller with Crucial-Micron's custom firmware and Micron's 16nm MLC NAND, but the biggest change&nbsp;compared to the MX100 is the addition of Dynamic Write Acceleration (DWA), which is the company's SLC cache&nbsp;implementation.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>George Stephanopoulos and Ali Wentworth's daughter Elliott is all grown up on big day see rare,</h2><time>Jun 8, 2024</time>
