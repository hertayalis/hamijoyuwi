Reeve was immediately rushed to the hospital, where he languished in a coma before coming around and learning the devastating news that he would be paralyzed for the rest of his life.</p><p>In his 1998 memoir, <a href=#>"Still Me,"</a> Reeve wrote that in the immediate aftermath of the accident, his mother gave up hope of him ever recovering. She argued with doctors that they should pull his life support and end her son's life, but they told her to wait and see if he made it through. Christopher admitted to sometimes feeling the same as his mother, once telling his wife Dana, "Maybe we should let me go." Dana was having none of it, though, assuring her husband she was there through thick and thin and that he was still the same person no matter what.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamppboB0g46ampyhlJq7tXnCoZinn5WZeqS00aKqraegnbKzedGenK%2BdXaG2p7GMn6arnaaav3A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./samsung-announces-the-galaxy-s10-10th-anniversary-trio.html><span>←</span><span>Samsung Announces The Galaxy S10: 10th Anniversary Trio</span></a>
