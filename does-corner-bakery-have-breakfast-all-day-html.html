 Answer
“Excellent location; breakfast is offered all day” Corner Bakery Cafe’s review. Good sandwiches, but their breakfast is my favourite. It’s available all day, but you’ll have to ask for the menu board to be flipped at night.
 
Also, can you have breakfast at Corner Bakery all day? They serve breakfast all day; simply request the ingredients and they will prepare them if they are in stock."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
