Before the band secured themselves a record deal, keys player Eric already had a job working on the cartoon shows, "The New Adventures of Mighty Mouse" and "Beany & Cecil," according to <a href=#>OC Weekly</a>. Around the same time, he was creating logos, T-shirt designs, and flyers for No Doubt. His talent outside of music was recognized pretty early on as Eric was asked to work for "The Simpsons" before the show became a household name.</p><p>No Doubt would eventually get signed and would release their first two albums, "No Doubt" and "The Beacon Street Collection." However, they weren't met with commercial success. After completing their third album, "Tragic Kingdom," it was believed that the record was never going to get released due to issues with the label. In 1994, before the album dropped, Eric made the decision to leave the band to center his attention on "The Simpsons" after being unhappy with the demands being made from the label. "I like to create," he told OC Weekly, adding, "But [touring] is too loud, with too many people. It's too much. I'd rather be somewhere peaceful. It takes peace and quiet to write a good song." Ultimately, No Doubt blew up shortly after "Tragic Kingdom" got released in 1995, becoming one of 92 albums to achieve diamond status in the U.S., per <a href=#>Billboard</a>, and Eric's <a href=#>contributions</a> to the legendary record remain.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcmhoaIZ4e9ahpmaho2K0uLHNZqqtnZaWu6q%2FjJupqKyYmr9usdGimmarpJqzorrIaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./veronas-juliet-statue-damaged-beyond-repair-love-seeking-tourists.html><span>←</span><span>Veronas Juliet statue removed after continued damage by love-seeking tourists</span></a>
