The upcoming third season of The Witcher — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">apparently split into two parts</a> — will feature Cavill as Geralt of Rivia throughout, with Hemsworth picking up the mantle starting from season 4.</p><p data-characters=466 data-current-count=466 data-injectable=true>The story is supposed to adapt Time of Contempt, which is the fourth book in the Witcher saga and involves a deadly skirmish between Geralt’s party and the Brotherhood of Sorcerers. We still don’t know how the story will justify the switch between the two actors, or whether it’ll address it at all, but at least we can go into season 3 with the comforting knowledge that we’ll have Henry Cavill as Geralt for at least another eight episodes.</p><p data-characters=156 data-current-count=156 data-injectable=false>The first part, consisting of five episodes, premieres on June 29, while the second part, containing the remaining three, arrives a month later on July 27.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yqv4yhnKeqqWKwosLIpaNmoZ5iwamxjLCgrZuYmr9uv8SaqqimXWh8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./in-the-wake-of-the-chaotic-adam-levine-saga-here-are-5-most-disturbing-celebrity-sexting-scandals.html><span>←</span><span>In the wake of the chaotic Adam Levine saga, here are 5 most disturbing celebrity sexting scandals</span></a>
