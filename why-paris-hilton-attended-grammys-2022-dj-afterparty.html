She also wore a custom martini-shaped bag designed by Peter Dundas in partnership with Grey Goose for the evening. The bespoke clutch took over a month to create and is embellished with over 3,400 Swarovski crystals set in an ombre blue design with three silver goose charms. But despite Hilton's glam look, people were confused by her presence at the Grammys.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Sure, Hilton graced the 2000s with bops like "Stars Are Blind" and "Nothing in This World," and in 2020, collaborated on the soundtrack for Promising Young Woman, but that's not why she attended the awards show.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On the red carpet, Hilton told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.accessonline.com/videos/paris-hilton-is-ready-to-grow-her-family-after-epic-wedding-i-cant-wait-for-the-babies data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Access Hollywood" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Access Hollywood</a> that she was called on to deejay a Grammys after-party—Olivia Rodrigo's after-party, to be exact.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I will be spinning it. It's going to be a lot of fun," she said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Hilton also praised the "Sour" singer, who <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a39617556/olivia-rodrigo-performance-grammys-2022/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="took home three awards" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">took home three awards</a> last night and gave various emotional speeches. "She's incredible, I'm so proud of her and all her success. She's nominated four times tonight, so it's an exciting night for her," Hilton said of Rodrigo.</p><img alt="las vegas, nevada april 03 paris hilton and carter reum attend the 64th annual grammy awards at mgm grand garden arena on april 03, 2022 in las vegas, nevada photo by frazer harrisongetty images for the recording academy" title="64th Annual GRAMMY Awards - Arrivals" width=683 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1389377584.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Frazer Harrison</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Hilton shared various photos on her <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/parishilton/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Instagram Story" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Instagram Story</a> of her deejaying in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/makeup/g39575266/best-beauty-grammys-2022/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="her sophisticated French manicure" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">her sophisticated French manicure</a> at Rodrigo's post-Grammys bash, and even videos of her singing and dancing with Rodrigo and her star-studded party crowd.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I love you Olivia!"
