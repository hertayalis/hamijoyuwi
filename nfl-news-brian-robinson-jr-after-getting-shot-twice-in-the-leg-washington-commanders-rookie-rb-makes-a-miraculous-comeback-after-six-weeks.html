<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>After Getting Shot Twice In The Leg, Washington Commanders Rookie RB Makes AMiraculous Comeback Aft</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>In August, Washington Commanders running back Brian Robinson Jr. got caught in an unfortunate incident, as he got shot twice in his leg during a robbery incident in Washington D.C. After that, he had to go through surgery to recover properly. It seems like his recovery has gone incredibly well, as he is all set to feature in the Commanders’ next game.</p><p>According to NFL insider Ian Rapoport, Washington is activating Robinson Jr. from the no non-football injury list, as he will likely to play against the Titans on Sunday.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Brian Robinson Jr. is likely to play against the Titans</h2><p>On Wednesday, Robinson Jr. returned to training with the Commanders, as his knee was not giving him any trouble. After a great training session, the medical team cleared him to <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>play</a> on Sunday against the Titans, which will be his NFL debut.</p><p>After the practice, Robinson talked to the reporters and <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>said</a>, “<span>It was beautiful. Just getting back on the field, having fun, being around my coaches and team again. Just a beautiful day.</span>“</p><img id=img-tag-node--img-loader-0 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/Brian-Robinson-Jr.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Interestingly, many saw him pointing toward the sky after a running back drill. When asked about it, he said, “<span>I did that because God was the first thing. I had to put him first… After I went through that running back drill you were talking about, I was forced to do a few movements and cuts in that drill that I wasn’t completely confident in before walking out on the field. So, after doing the drill, that just helped me gain more confidence in myself.</span>“</p><p>It is worth noting that the Commanders drafted the 23-year-old out of Alabama last April. Since then, he has been sitting on the sidelines, waiting for an opportunity. Finally, on Sunday, he will get the chance to showcase his talent; however, it is still unknown how many minutes he will play.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Commanders had a terrible start to the season</h2><p>While Robinson Jr. was out, Antonio Gibson and J.D. McKissic have been taking care of the running back duties for the team. Safe to say, their performances have not lived up to the hype, as the <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Commanders</a>‘ season has been falling apart.</p><p>After a winning start to the season against the Jaguars, the Washington side has lost three games in a row. Particularly in the last two games, their offense did not work at all. With Robinson Jr. coming back to the team, it will be interesting to see if their offense improves drastically against the <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Titans</a>.</p><p><strong>Watch This Story: <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Washington Commenders trading for Indianapolis Colts QB Carson Wentz&nbsp;</a></strong></p><p>Can the Commanders get back to winning ways against the Titans?
