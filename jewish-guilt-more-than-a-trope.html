One is evil — he is anger, envy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority, and ego.”</p><p>“The other is good — he is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion, and faith. The same fight is going on inside you —&nbsp;and inside every other person, too.”</p><p>The grandson thought about it and asked his grandfather: “Which wolf will win?”</p><p>The old man replied, “The one you feed.”</p><p>Judaism teaches that when we harm others as a consequence of the evil impulse (yetzer ha-ra, in Hebrew), we must take responsibility, acknowledge the wrong, commit ourselves not to repeat it, and ask the aggrieved party for forgiveness. Without true repentance, or <a href=#>teshuvah</a>, and forgiveness, we remain guilty.</p><p>This is true in our relationships and in society as a whole. Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, the famous 20th century theologian, said: “We must continue to remind ourselves that in a free society all are involved in what some are doing. Some are guilty, all are responsible.”</p><p>John L. Rosove is Senior Rabbi at Temple Israel of Hollywood, the national chairman of the Association of Reform Zionists of America, and the author of “Why Judaism Matters: Letters of a Liberal Rabbi to His Children and the Millennial Generation” (Jewish Lights, 2017).</p><h3 class=m-newsletter__heading>Join Our Newsletter</h3><p>Empower your Jewish discovery, daily</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rsXJnq6iq5ihsqK%2BzaKloGaTpLpwrdGtoJyklWS3psPIrJ9mn6WeubV5zKipnmWkna6vecBmq6unoJp8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./get-to-know-amy-schumer-biography-age-career-net-worth-height-relationship-more.html><span>←</span><span>Get to know Amy Schumer: Biography, Age, Career, Net Worth, Height, Relationship &amp;amp; More</span></a>
