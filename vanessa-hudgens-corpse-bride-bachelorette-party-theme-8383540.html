From her multiple costume changes to filling her Instagram grid with black-and-white-only photos for the whole month of October, the actress is really into spooky season. So, when it came time to celebrate her upcoming wedding to fiancé Cole Tucker, Vanessa, of course, had a bachelorette party that incorporated her favorite time of the year.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Thursday, Vanessa shared a series of photos from the bash, and in them, she dressed up as bride in a white lace gown, which she accessorized with a star-studded crown, sheer opera gloves, and a wedding veil that had her and Cole's initials embroidered on the front with a heart in between. She slicked her raven tresses back into a sleek bun and rounded out her glam with a dark smoky eye and a vampy lip. Meanwhile, her group of six girlfriends wore head-to-toe black (as if they were attending a funeral) at the event.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Love a theme night. Can you guess what it was?," Vanessa asked her followers in the caption of her post. In response, fans flooded the comments section with their pedictions. Many guessed "corpse bride," while one user wrote, "Til death do us party." Another added, "It's a funeral for your singlehood, how French!!" Without commenting on the theme itself, others speculated that her wedding day would be on Halloween.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Vanessa and Cole first sparked dating rumors back in November 2020 after they met on a Zoom group meditation call during the pandemic. The two officially confirmed their relationship on Valentine's Day 2021 with a kissing photo on Instagram, and two years later, they <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>got engaged</a> in Paris.&nbsp;<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK571ZqlnqujlnqpwcOgnKerXZi8s7zSnmSbqpmZsm6uwJyfnqSfp7K1wMRmp5qqpK56tbTEppxmcGNtgHaAjw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./remnant-from-the-ashes-how-to-beat-shroud-boss-fight.html><span>←</span><span>Remnant: From the Ashes - How to Beat Shroud</span></a>
