Christopher Reeve's A-lister days ended in 1995 after he unwittingly joined the heartbreaking list of celebs who disappeared after an injury. The actor was in prime fitness when he suffered a freak accident while competing in a showjumping competition on Memorial Day weekend in 1995. History&nbsp;explains that the experienced equestrian was thrown from his horse, severing his spinal cord and leaving him paralyzed from the neck down.
As Life Stories notes, Reeve was approaching the course's third jump when his horse abruptly ground to a halt and dug in its hooves, resulting in him being catapulted from the saddle and landing on his head.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The High-Powered Cast of 'Selling the Hamptons' Has Cornered the Long Island Real Estate Market</h2><time>Jul 9, 2024</time>

<a href=../../the-untold-truth-of-shamwow.html></a>
Why has ShamWow fever died down?&nbsp;First of all, some of the claims in the famous&nbsp;ShamWow commercial are patently ridiculous. At one point, Offer claims that Olympic divers use ShamWow as a towel. Maybe there's some sad, ShamWow sponsored diver out there who actually does, but it's definitely not the norm. The commercial also claims you can use it as bathmat, which is probably true. You could use an old t-shirt as a bathmat if you wanted to — seriously, no one can stop you — but a bathmat that was meant to be a bathmat is clearly going to be a better bathmat.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>'Sense &amp;amp; Sensibility' &amp;amp; 'Love Actually' Share This Strange Connection</h2><time>Jul 8, 2024</time>

As a British actor, it is pretty much a requirement that you are in a period piece — preferably a Jane Austen-inspired period piece — at some time or another in your career. The Jane Austen book-turned-movie Sense and Sensibility turns 20 years old on Dec. 13, 2015 and director Ang Lee helped a lot of British actors get that period piece requisite checked off their list back in 1995. Star Emma Thompson, as the reasonable Elinor Dashwood, was in the film with many familiar faces that she later worked with again in movies like the Harry Potter franchise and Love Actually.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Andrs Guibert</h2><time>Jul 8, 2024</time>
