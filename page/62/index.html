Carrying over the grim, murkier aesthetic from Rogue One, Andor feels much more mature and adult-oriented than perhaps every other entry in the saga. So it probably only makes sense that the show just achieved a foul-mouthed first for the family-friendly franchise.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Feline internet celebrity Jorts the Cat slammed over ableist Instacart comments</h2><time>Jun 20, 2024</time>
