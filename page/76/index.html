Before his retirement, Kevin Ford, who worked for Burger King for 27 years, never missed a day of work. His employer sent him a gift package filled with pencils, chocolates, movie tickets, and a Starbucks cup during his final days at work as compensation for his years of devoted service.
The 54-year-old guy went viral after his daughter Seryna revealed the farewell gift her dad received on social media.
She made the decision to create a GoFundMe page to thank him for being able to support his family and pay for the college education of his four children over the course of many years of labor.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Jimi Hendrix One Rainy Wish lyric</h2><time>Jun 3, 2024</time>

Golden rose, the color of the dream I had
Not too long ago
A misty blue and the lilac too
A never to grow old.A there you were under the tree of song
Sleeping so peacefully
In your hand a flower played
A waiting there for me.

Laid eyes on you
Not like a before
